### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One of the first concepts I learned was assigning the value the user inputs to a specific variable. Variables are important because they are used to store data in memory. Variables can be assigned a name to see its value or to change its value. This can be done by using the reserved word, "var". 
2. The second concept I learned was the clearForm method. This method removes all of the expense values the user types into the form. The method is executed when the Clear Form button is clicked. It's helpful for the user if they make a mistake and just want to start from the beginning or want to complete the expense calculator again. 
3. The last concept I learned was the parseFloat method. The purpose of this method is to convert a string to a floating point number. This code helped in this assignment to recognize the values in the textbox as strings and convert those values into a float for each catgeory.
